# üñ• Frontend Development Track

Welcome to the Frontend Development track of DevLabs 2025! This track focuses on building modern, responsive, and interactive web applications using React.js and Next.js.

## üéØ Track Overview

In this track, you'll learn how to create engaging user interfaces and deliver exceptional user experiences. From basic components to complex state management, you'll master the skills needed to build professional web applications that users love.

## üõ† Technologies

### React.js
React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, particularly single-page applications. It's used for handling the view layer and allows you to create reusable UI components.

### Next.js
Next.js is a React framework that enables functionality such as server-side rendering, static site generation, and improved routing. It provides a better developer experience and performance optimization out of the box.

## üìö What You'll Learn

- *Component-Based Architecture:* Breaking down UIs into reusable, maintainable pieces
- *State Management:* Managing application data flow effectively
- *Hooks System:* Using React's modern API for state and effects
- *Routing:* Creating multi-page experiences with client-side navigation
- *API Integration:* Connecting frontend with backend services
- *Styling Approaches:* CSS modules, styled-components, and Tailwind CSS
- *Form Handling:* Collecting and validating user input
- *Performance Optimization:* Making your applications fast and responsive
- *Testing:* Writing tests for your components and functionality
- *Deployment:* Getting your application online
## ‚è±Ô∏è Timeline Overview

> üìÖ Total Duration: 3.5 Weeks  
> üéØ Final Goal: Build a fully functional frontend for Taskify using React, integrated with the Taskify backend API.

## üìç Phase 1: Web Development Fundamentals (Week 1 to Mid Week 2)

**Duration:** ~1.5 Weeks  
**Objective:** Build a strong foundation in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript  

### Topics Covered:
- **HTML**
  - Elements, structure, forms, inputs, semantics
- **CSS**
  - Flexbox, layout design, responsiveness, media queries
- **JavaScript**
  - Variables, functions, arrays, objects
  - DOM manipulation
  - Event listeners and form handling
  - Local storage basics

### Practice Projects:
- Personal portfolio page
- Interactive form validation
- To-do list or notes app using plain JavaScript

---

## üìç Phase 2: React + Taskify Development (Mid Week 2 to Week 3.5)

**Duration:** ~2 Weeks  
**Objective:** Learn React while building Taskify step-by-step  
**Frontend features will mirror backend API functionality.**

### Concepts Introduced (as needed):
- React setup (Vite or CRA)
- JSX syntax
- Components and props
- `useState` for managing form inputs and UI
- `useEffect` for fetching data and persisting to localStorage or backend
- API calls using `fetch` or Axios
- Error handling and loading states
- Component-based structure for:
  - Task management (CRUD)
  - Note management (CRUD)
  - User authentication (JWT)
- Optional: Routing with `react-router` if time permits

### Taskify Features to Implement:
- User login and registration
- Create, read, update, delete tasks
- Create, read, update, delete notes
- Mark tasks as done
- Task status and priority
- Input validation
- Persistent login using JWT token
- Protected views/routes (optional)

---

## üìç Final Deliverables

- Fully functional Taskify frontend built in React
- Clean component structure and state management
- Integration with backend APIs for authentication, tasks, and notes
- Polished UI with responsiveness
- Deployment-ready frontend (GitHub Pages, Vercel, or Netlify)

---

## üöÄ Tips for Success

- Learn by building: every new concept will be taught directly through a Taskify feature.
- Ask questions ‚Äî mentors are here to help!
- Don‚Äôt chase perfection on the first try. Build first, polish later.
## üöÄ Project Components

For the Taskify project, each track will be responsible for the following components:

### Frontend Track
- User authentication interface
- Dashboard with task and note summaries
- Task creation and management interface
- Notes creation and editing system
- Search and filter functionality
- Responsive design for all device sizes

## üë®‚Äçüíª Technical Requirements

- *Code Quality:* Follow best practices, maintain clean and readable code
- *Component Structure:* Properly organized component hierarchy
- *State Management:* Efficient state management practices
- *Performance:* Optimized rendering and loading
- *Responsiveness:* Works well on all device sizes
- *Accessibility:* Basic accessibility considerations
- *Documentation:* Well-documented components and functionality
