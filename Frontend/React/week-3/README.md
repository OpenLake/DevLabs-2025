# Week 3 – Build Taskify Frontend & Learn React Side-by-Side

Welcome to Week 3! This week, you will simultaneously learn React fundamentals and build the frontend of Taskify — a simple productivity app with Tasks, Notes, and Profile screens. We won’t connect to the backend yet; focus is on building a fully functional frontend prototype with mock data.

## Goals

- Learn React basics: components, state, props, hooks, and routing.
- Build a Home screen showing mock tasks.
- Create a Navbar for navigation between Tasks, Notes, and Profile.
- Develop Notes and Profile pages with dummy data.
- Use Tailwind CSS for responsive and clean UI.
- Practice managing state and interactivity in React.

## Day-by-Day Plan

**Day 15–16: React Setup & Navbar**  
- Set up React project with Vite and Tailwind CSS.  
- Learn about React components and JSX syntax.  
- Build a reusable Navbar component with React Router for navigation.

**Day 17–18: Tasks Screen**  
- Learn useState hook for managing state.  
- Create a Home screen showing a list of mock tasks.  
- Implement Add, Edit, and Delete task functionality (using React state).

**Day 19–20: Notes Screen**  
- Practice passing props to components.  
- Build Notes screen with dummy notes stored in state.  
- Add functionality for adding and editing notes.

**Day 21: Profile Screen & UI Polishing**  
- Create a Profile page with static/dummy user info.  
- Focus on UI polish: responsiveness, hover effects, transitions.  
- Review and reinforce React concepts learned this week.

## What You’ll Learn

## Keep in Mind

- Learn and build simultaneously for better understanding.  
- Write clean, modular React code.  
- Test your app regularly as you add features.  
- Share your progress with the team and collaborate.
