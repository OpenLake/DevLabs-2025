# üì± App Development Track

Welcome to the App Development track of **DevLabs 2025**! This track focuses on building modern, responsive, and feature-rich mobile applications using **Kotlin** for native Android development and **Flutter** for cross-platform development.

---

## üéØ Track Overview

In this track, you‚Äôll learn how to build high-quality mobile apps that offer seamless user experiences. From UI design to API integration, you'll master the tools and frameworks needed to bring mobile applications to life on Android (and optionally iOS via Flutter).

---

## üõ† Technologies

### Kotlin (Native Android)

Kotlin is a modern programming language officially supported by Google for Android development. It is expressive, concise, and designed to be safer than Java. With Android Studio and Jetpack components, Kotlin allows full control over native app development.

### Flutter (Cross-platform)

Flutter is a UI toolkit by Google for crafting beautiful, natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase. It uses the Dart programming language and provides fast development with expressive and flexible UI components.

## üìö What You'll Learn

- **Mobile UI Development**: Creating responsive and intuitive layouts  
- **Activity & Fragment Lifecycles (Kotlin)**: Managing app screens effectively  
- **Widgets & Navigation (Flutter)**: Structuring app screens and transitions  
- **State Management**: Managing UI and application data  
- **Networking**: API calls using Retrofit (Kotlin) or http/Dio (Flutter)  
- **Authentication**: Implementing secure login and registration  
- **Data Persistence**: Using Room DB (Kotlin) or local storage solutions (Flutter)  
- **Form Handling & Validation**: Ensuring reliable user input  
- **Animations & Transitions**: Enhancing user experience  
- **App Deployment**: Preparing your app for the Google Play Store

## üß† DevLabs App Development Learning Timeline (3.5 Weeks)

This timeline is designed for beginners to learn mobile development from scratch, starting with basic layouts and ending with a fully functional **Taskify** mobile app.

### ‚è±Ô∏è Timeline Overview

- üìÖ **Total Duration**: 3.5 Weeks  
- üéØ **Final Goal**: Build a fully functional **Taskify** mobile app using Kotlin or Flutter, integrated with the Taskify backend API.

## üìç Phase 1: Mobile Development Fundamentals (Week 1 to Mid Week 2)

- **Duration**: ~1.5 Weeks  
- **Objective**: Build foundational skills in mobile development (UI, navigation, state, events)

### Topics Covered (Kotlin or Flutter based on track):

- **UI Design**
  - Views, layouts, and styling
  - Material Design principles

- **User Interaction**
  - Buttons, input fields, event handling

- **Navigation**
  - Screen transitions, passing data

- **State Management Basics**
  - Handling input and UI updates

- **Project Setup**
  - Android Studio (Kotlin) or VSCode/Android Studio (Flutter)

### Practice Projects:

- Simple login/register screen  
- Counter app with state  
- Notes or to-do app with local storage  

---

## üìç Phase 2: Taskify App Development (Mid Week 2 to Week 3.5)

- **Duration**: ~2 Weeks  
- **Objective**: Build the full Taskify app with backend integration

### Key Concepts:

- Backend API integration (Retrofit or Dio/http)  
- Reusable components and modular design  
- Advanced form handling and validation  
- UI state feedback (loading, error, empty views)  
- Authentication using JWT  
- Optional: Push notifications or local notifications  

### Taskify Features to Implement:

- User authentication (login/register)  
- Create, read, update, delete tasks  
- Create, read, update, delete notes  
- Mark tasks as complete  
- Task priority and filtering  
- Persistent login using JWT token  
- Protected screens (authenticated routes)  
- Responsive design across screen sizes  

---

## üìç Final Deliverables

- ‚úÖ Fully functional **Taskify** mobile app (Kotlin or Flutter)  
- ‚úÖ Clean and modular codebase  
- ‚úÖ API integration with full CRUD and authentication  
- ‚úÖ Responsive and polished UI  
- ‚úÖ Ready-to-deploy APK (or iOS build if applicable)  

---

## üöÄ Tips for Success

- Choose one track (**Kotlin** or **Flutter**) and go deep  
- Follow the step-by-step implementation for Taskify  
- Break down features into small, testable chunks  
- Collaborate with your team and ask questions early  
- Focus on functionality first, polish later  

---

## üì± Project Components

- User login and registration screens  
- Dashboard with task and note summaries  
- Task management interface  
- Notes creation/editing interface  
- Search, filter, and priority tags  
- Token storage and session management  
- Offline-friendly behavior (optional)
