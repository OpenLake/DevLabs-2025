# üì± App Development Track

Welcome to the App Development track of DevLabs 2025! This track focuses on building cross-platform and native mobile applications using Flutter and Kotlin for Android.

## üéØ Track Overview

In this track, you'll learn how to design, develop, and deploy mobile applications that provide great user experiences across different devices. From UI components to data persistence, you'll gain the skills needed to build professional mobile applications that users can take anywhere.

## üõ† Technologies

### Flutter
Flutter is Google's UI toolkit for building beautiful, natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase. It uses Dart as its programming language.

### Kotlin (Android)
Kotlin is a modern programming language used for Android app development. When paired with Jetpack Compose (Google's modern toolkit for building native UI), it enables you to create elegant, powerful Android applications.

## ‚ùì FAQ

*Q: Do I need to know both Flutter and Kotlin?*  
A: No, you can choose to specialize in one technology based on your interest. However, understanding the concepts of both can be beneficial.

*Q: Do I need a Mac to develop for iOS with Flutter?*  
A: For testing on iOS devices and publishing to the App Store, you would need a Mac. However, you can still develop and test on Android without one.

*Q: What kind of hardware do I need?*  
A: Any reasonably modern computer should work. For best results, 8GB RAM or more is recommended. For Android development, an Android device is useful but not required (emulators can be used).

*Q: How much time commitment is expected?*  
A: Plan for approximately 10-15 hours per week for best results.

*Q: Will we be publishing the apps to the Play Store?*  
A: We'll prepare the app for submission, but actual publishing will depend on the project outcome and OpenLake policies.
