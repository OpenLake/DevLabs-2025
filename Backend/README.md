# ‚öô Backend Development Track

Welcome to the Backend Development track of DevLabs 2025! This track focuses on building robust server-side applications, APIs, and database systems that power web and mobile applications.

## üéØ Track Overview

In this track, you'll learn how to design and implement the server-side components of applications. From API development to database design, authentication systems to deployment, you'll master the skills needed to build scalable and secure backend services.

## üõ† Technologies

### Node.js
Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine, enabling server-side execution of JavaScript code. It's widely used for building fast, scalable network applications.

### Express/NestJS
Express is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications. NestJS is a progressive Node.js framework for building efficient, reliable, and scalable server-side applications.

### PostgreSQL
PostgreSQL is a powerful, open-source object-relational database system with over 30 years of active development that has earned it a strong reputation for reliability, feature robustness, and performance.
