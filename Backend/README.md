# ‚öô Backend Development Track: Taskify

Welcome to the Backend Development track of DevLabs 2025! This track focuses on building the Taskify: Personalized Management System - a robust backend service that powers task management and note-taking applications.

## üéØ Track Overview

In this track, you'll learn how to design and implement the server-side components of the Taskify application. From API development to database design, authentication systems to deployment, you'll master the skills needed to build a scalable and secure backend service for task and note management.

## üõ† Technologies

### Multiple Backend Frameworks
We'll explore and implement our backend using three major frameworks:
- **Node.js/Express**: A lightweight and flexible JavaScript framework
- **FastAPI**: A modern, fast Python web framework
- **Spring Boot**: A Java-based framework for creating production-ready applications

### PostgreSQL

## ‚ùì FAQ

*Q: Do I need prior backend development experience?*  
A: While prior experience is helpful, the track is designed to accommodate beginners with a solid programming foundation. We'll cover the basics of backend development from the ground up.

*Q: Do I need to learn all three frameworks (Node.js/Express, FastAPI, and Spring Boot)?*  
A: No, you can choose to focus on one framework based on your preference or prior experience. However, understanding the concepts across different frameworks will broaden your knowledge.

*Q: How much time should I dedicate to this track weekly?*  
A: We recommend dedicating at least 10-15 hours per week to get the most out of this track, including lectures, hands-on coding, and self-study.
